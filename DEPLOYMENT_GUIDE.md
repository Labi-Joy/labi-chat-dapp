# Deployment Guide for Labi Chat DApp

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Theme Toggle Functionality
- **Issue**: Theme toggle was not working properly for users to choose between light and dark mode
- **Solution**: Fixed the theme provider configuration by removing `disableTransitionOnChange` and ensuring proper theme switching
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Users can now toggle between light, dark, and system themes

### 2. Build Errors
- **Issue**: Multiple build errors including missing wagmi config and WagmiProvider errors during static generation
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Created missing `lib/wagmi.ts` file to export wagmi config
  - Fixed API routes by adding GET methods to make them compatible with Next.js build process
  - Fixed profile page by implementing client-side mounting pattern to prevent WagmiProvider errors during static generation
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Build now completes successfully with `pnpm run build`

### 3. Vercel Deployment Preparation
- **Issue**: Project needed to be prepared for Vercel deployment
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Created `vercel.json` configuration file
  - Fixed all build errors to ensure successful deployment
  - Added proper environment variable handling
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment
